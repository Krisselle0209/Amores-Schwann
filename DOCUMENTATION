1. PYTHON LIGHT BLUE HEART

  2. What is the purpose of your project? Tell about your project. The purpose of my project is to make a light blue heart using codes and to learn more on how to make codes. My project is kind of hard to make 
  because im not really familiar of different codes. I used and researched different examples of codes and experimented to make a heart. The color of my heart is light blue and the background color is black.

  3. How your program wrorks? Explain how to run your code.
  My program works by running the code to make a heart. I used imports and parametric functions like (hearta(k)) and (heartb(k)) to calculate the coordinates of a heart and draws 
  using a turtle module. Dont forget to always put done() before running your code so that your code can run properly an will stop drawing. To run my code i will first download visual studio 
  code and make my code there, when i finished my code i clicked run and pressed run without debugging and clicked python debugger and the code will run automatically.
